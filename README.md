# WackyFlipGame

Welcome to **[Wacky Flip](https://wackyflip.org)**, a casual web-based game inspired by *Wacky Flip*! Jump, flip, and land on targets in a basketball court environment, powered by ragdoll-style physics and parkour mechanics. Built with HTML, JavaScript (p5.js), and Tailwind CSS, this game is perfect for players and developers alike.

## Features
- **Dynamic Flipping**: Perform flips with mouse controls and aim for perfect landings.
- **Ragdoll Physics**: Simulated physics for hilarious and unpredictable jumps.
- **High-Score System**: Chain combos to boost your score and climb the leaderboard.
- **Casual Fun**: Easy to play, hard to master—ideal for quick gaming sessions.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clear code and docs for easy customization.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. **Hold** the left mouse button to charge your jump.
3. **Release** to launch into the air.
4. **Click** mid-air to flip; release to stop flipping.
5. Land on the target to score points—center landings earn max points!
6. Chain flips for combo multipliers and aim for the high score.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wackyflip/WackyFlipGame.git
2. Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. No server or dependencies required—p5.js and Tailwind CSS are loaded via CDN.

## Usage
To run the game:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/wackyflip/WackyFlipGame.git
2. Open index.html in a browser.
3. Play by holding the mouse to charge a jump, releasing to launch, and clicking mid-air to flip.

## Notes

* The game implements a single environment (Basketball Court) for simplicity. Developers can extend it by adding new levels or tricks in sketch.js.
* Ragdoll physics are approximated with rotation and gravity; advanced physics can be added using libraries like Matter.js.
* The README is SEO-optimized with keywords and clear CTAs to attract players and contributors.
* The code is commented for transparency and ease of understanding, aligning with Google's helpful content standards.
